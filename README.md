# LOD_accommodation
Example R codes for environmental mixture analysis and LOD accommodation approaches. This includes:
- Implementation of Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression, Elastic net, and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) as popular mixture methods
- LOD accommodation apporahces for exposures subject to Limit of Detection (LOD): Complete-case analysis, LOD/sqrt(2), conventional multiple imputation (using 'mice' R package), truncated multiple imputation, and a mehtod using AFT model
